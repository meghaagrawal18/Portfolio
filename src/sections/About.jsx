                I am Megha Agrawal, a passionate developer currently pursuing
                Information Science and Engineering at BMS College of
                Engineering. I am deeply committed to solving real-world
                problems through technology and enjoy working on projects that
                blend creativity with technical depth.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have worked on AI-driven systems like CareSync, a healthcare
                platform designed for rural environments, and a machine
                learning- based vehicle recognition and analytics solution. I
                enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source
                initiatives, and collaborating with communities that push the
                boundaries of what's possible in tech.
